# Note-Goat-Application
Group project for SENG 401 - Software Architecture

## Description

This Django project includes the backend, frontend, and tests 
for a note taking web application. The application is for 
registered users to write notes, organize them in folders, and 
share the notes. Users can also view or edit other userâ€™s notes 
if they are shared with them. This is all done through the usage 
of accounts. Users may create their own account through the sign
up page.

## Usage

The site has been deployed on https://note-goat-site.herokuapp.com/
where the full website can be accessed. However, if you would like
to run the site locally, simply follow the following instructions:

We assume that you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

To run this program, start by setting up a python virtual 
environment in the folder where Note-Goat-Application-Frontend-
resides. This can be done by running 
```
python3 -m venv CPSC471Project
source CPSC471Project/bin/activate
```
on Mac/Linux or 
```
pip install virtualenv
python -m virtualenv . 
.\scripts\activate
```
on Windows. You may need to run `.\scripts\activate` twice;
you will know it worked when your command prompt starts with
parentheses, like this:
```
(Note-Goat-Application-Frontend-) username@computer seng401 %
```

Next, we have to install Django, using 
```
python -m pip install Django
```
on Mac/Linux or
```
py -m pip install Django
```
on Windows. If you have run into any issues so far, consult
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/install/ or
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/install/#installing-official-release

Finally, you must install some of the extensions we use in this project:
```
pip install django-crispy-forms
pip install whitenoise
pip install django-tinymce
```

Now it is time to set up the server. Navigate to the inner
folder containing `manage.py`. Then run
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
and in the browser of your choice, go to
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
where you should see a welcome page. 

From here, you can navigate to the webpages of our Note Goat site.
